# CurrentSense-PoC
## Hardware Materials:
* [INA219 Current Measuring over I2C board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/904),
* Arduino Nano  Nano 33 BLE Sense for target board, and
* Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense ML capable board

The [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) 2.0 Beta version was used for the experiment.
## Arduino Libraries:
* Adafruit INA219 1.1.1
* Arduino_TensorFlowLite 2.4.0-ALPHA


## Note:
This proof of concept work is based on [CurrentSense-TinyML](https://github.com/Santandersecurityresearch/CurrentSense-TinyML) in reference with [jupyter notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Santandersecurityresearch/CurrentSense-TinyML/blob/main/TinyML-CurrentSense-Writeup.ipynb).
